        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Meat sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add chopped onions and minced garlic; sauté until softened.</li>
                    <li>Add the ground beef (or pork), cooking until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
                    <li>Stir in tomato sauce, tomato paste, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Let the sauce simmer for 20-30 minutes to deepen the flavors.</li>
                    <li>Add fresh basil for extra flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:
                <ul>
                    <li>Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until they are <en>al dente</en>.</li>
                    <li>Drain and lay the noodles flat on a sheet of parchment paper or a greased surface to avoid sticking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Cheese Mixture:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine ricotta cheese, an egg, spinach (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Stir in half of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese to create a rich, creamy mixture.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Layer the Lasagna:
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom.</li>
                    <li>Add a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture, and then another layer of meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>Repeat this process until you have three or four layers.</li>
                    <li>Finish with a layer of noodles, topped with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bake the Lasagna:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent excessive browning) and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden on top.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Let it Rest and Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with extra basil or Parmesan cheese, and serve with garlic bread on the side for a complete meal.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Enjoy your mouth-watering <strong>Lasagna</strong>!</p>
