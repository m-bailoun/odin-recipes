        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><strong>Mulukhiyah</strong> is a famous <em>Lebanese</em> dish
        widely adopted around the world simply due to how delicious it is!
        Even though the dish itself is known as Mulukhiyah, it is actually
        the main vegetable included in the dish that's called Mulukhiyah.
        Yup, the green leaves you see in the picture above. Mulukhiyah is known
        as the <strong>King of vegetables</strong> due to its great nutritional value.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <p>These steps are my personal favorite, you won't be disappointed!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Boil the Chicken:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large pot, place the chicken, quartered onion, bay leaves, cinnamon stick, and salt and pepper. Cover with water and bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Skim any foam that forms on the surface and let it simmer for about 45 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.</li>
                    <li>Remove the chicken, set it aside to cool, then shred the meat. Save the broth to use in the mulukhiyah.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Mulukhiyah Leaves:
                <ul>
                    <li>If using fresh mulukhiyah, wash and finely chop the leaves.</li>
                    <li>If using frozen mulukhiyah, let it thaw completely before cooking. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the Garlic and Coriander:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a small pan, melt the butter (or ghee) over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add minced garlic and ground coriander, and saut√© for a couple of minutes until fragrant and golden brown. This is called taqliya, a key flavor in the dish.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cook the Mulukhiyah:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large pot, bring 4 cups of the chicken broth to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Add the mulukhiyah leaves and cook for about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the leaves soften and the mixture becomes slightly thick. Do not overcook to avoid losing the green color.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the garlic and coriander mixture (taqliya), and season with cumin, salt, and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Add lemon juice (optional) for a tangy flavor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Combine and Serve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the shredded chicken back into the mulukhiyah and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Serve the mulukhiyah over a bed of rice, with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the dish.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
